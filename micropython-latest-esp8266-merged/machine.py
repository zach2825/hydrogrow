functions related to the hardware. See: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/machine.html

The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
(like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
damage.

    Access the pin peripheral (GPIO pin) associated with the given ``id``.  If
    additional arguments are given in the constructor then they are used to initialise
    the pin.  Any settings that are not specified will remain in their previous state.

    The arguments are:

      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
        (pair of [port, pin]).

      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:

        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
          is in high-impedance state.

        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.

        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.

        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.

      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
        one of:

        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.

      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
        unchanged.

      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.

      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
        ports implement this argument.

    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

               ``Pin`` instance.

             - ``trigger`` configures the event which can generate an interrupt.
               Possible values are:

               - ``Pin.IRQ_RISING`` interrupt on rising edge.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL`` interrupt on low level.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL`` interrupt on high level.

               These values can be OR'ed together to trigger on multiple events.

             - ``priority`` sets the priority level of the interrupt.  The values it
               can take are port-specific, but higher values always represent higher
               priorities.

             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.
               These values can also be OR'ed together to make a pin generate interrupts in
               more than one power mode.

             - ``hard`` if true a hardware interrupt is used. This reduces the delay
               between the pin change and the handler being called. Hard interrupt
               handlers may not allocate memory; see :ref:`isr_rules`.

              - ``0`` will not invert lines (idle state of both lines is logic high).
              - ``UART.INV_TX`` will invert TX line (idle state of TX line now logic low).
              - ``UART.INV_RX`` will invert RX line (idle state of RX line now logic low).

          - *flow* specifies which hardware flow control signals to use. The value
            is a bitmask.

              - ``0`` will ignore hardware flow control signals.
              - ``UART.RTS`` will enable receive flow control by using the RTS output pin to
                signal if the receive FIFO has sufficient space to accept more data.
              - ``UART.CTS`` will enable transmit flow control by pausing transmission when the
                CTS input pin signals that the receiver is running low on buffer space.
              - ``UART.RTS | UART.CTS`` will enable both, for full hardware flow control.

        On the WiPy only the following keyword-only parameter is supported:

          - *pins* is a 4 or 2 item list indicating the TX, RX, RTS and CTS pins (in that order).
            Any of the pins can be None if one wants the UART to operate with limited functionality.
            If the RTS pin is given the the RX pin must be given as well. The same applies to CTS.
            When no pins are given, then the default set of TX and RX pins is taken, and hardware
            flow control will be disabled. If *pins* is ``None``, no pin assignment will be made.

          It is possible to call ``init()`` multiple times on the same object in

          peripheral to serve different devices attached to different GPIO pins.
          Only one device can be served at a time in that case.
